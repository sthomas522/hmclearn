	abstract = {Tuning the durations of the Hamiltonian flow in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (also called Hybrid Monte Carlo) ({HMC}) involves a tradeoff between computational cost and sampling quality, which is typically challenging to resolve in a satisfactory way. In this article we present and analyze a randomized {HMC} method ({RHMC}), in which these durations are i.i.d. exponential random variables whose mean is a free parameter. We focus on the small time step size limit, where the algorithm is rejection-free and the computational cost is proportional to the mean duration. In this limit, we prove that {RHMC} is geometrically ergodic under the same conditions that imply geometric ergodicity of the solution to underdamped Langevin equations. Moreover, in the context of a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution, we prove that the sampling efficiency of {RHMC}, unlike that of constant duration {HMC}, behaves in a regular way. This regularity is also verified numerically in non-Gaussian target distributions. Finally we suggest variants of {RHMC} for which the time step size is not required to be small.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}) sampling methods provide a mechanism for defining distant proposals with high acceptance probabilities in a Metropolis-Hastings framework, enabling more efficient exploration of the state space than standard random-walk proposals. The popularity of such methods has grown significantly in recent years. However, a limitation of {HMC} methods is the required gradient computation for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system--such computation is infeasible in problems involving a large sample size or streaming data. Instead, we must rely on a noisy gradient estimate computed from a subset of the data. In this paper, we explore the properties of such a stochastic gradient {HMC} approach. Surprisingly, the natural implementation of the stochastic approximation can be arbitrarily bad. To address this problem we introduce a variant that uses second-order Langevin dynamics with a friction term that counteracts the effects of the noisy gradient, maintaining the desired target distribution as the invariant distribution. Results on simulated data validate our theory. We also provide an application of our methods to a classification task using neural networks and to online Bayesian matrix factorization.},

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David {MacKay}'s groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes a Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The method provides a fully automated adaptation mechanism that circumvents the costly pilot runs required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings or indeed Hybrid Monte Carlo and Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The proposed method exploits the Riemannian structure of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local manifold structure at each step based on the metric tensor. A semi-explicit second order symplectic integrator for non-separable Hamiltonians is derived for simulating paths across this manifold which provides highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of the Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method is assessed by performing posterior inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models, and Bayesian estimation of parameter posteriors of dynamical systems described by nonlinear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time normalised Effective Sample Size are reported when compared to alternative sampling approaches.

This augmentation both helps improve mixing in multimodal targets and allows the normalisation constant of the target distribution to be estimated. The method is simple to implement within existing {HMC} code, requiring only a standard leapfrog integrator. We demonstrate experimentally that the method is competitive with annealed importance sampling and simulating tempering methods at sampling from challenging multimodal distributions and estimating their normalising constants.},

	abstract = {We consider the Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({RMHMC}) method for solving statistical inverse problems governed by partial differential equations ({PDEs}). The Bayesian framework is employed to cast the inverse problem into the task of statistical inference whose solution is the posterior distribution in infinite dimensional parameter space conditional upon observation data and Gaussian prior measure. We discretize both the likelihood and the prior using the H 1 -conforming finite element method together with a matrix transfer technique. The power of the {RMHMC} method is that it exploits the geometric structure induced by the {PDE} constraints of the underlying inverse problem. Consequently, each {RMHMC} posterior sample is almost uncorrelated/independent from the others providing statistically efficient Markov chain simulation. However this statistical efficiency comes at a computational cost. This motivates us to consider computationally more efficient strategies for {RMHMC}. At the heart of our construction is the fact that for Gaussian error structures the Fisher information matrix coincides with the Gauss–Newton Hessian. We exploit this fact in considering a computationally simplified {RMHMC} method combining state-of-the-art adjoint techniques and the superiority of the {RMHMC} method. Specifically, we first form the Gauss–Newton Hessian at the maximum a posteriori point and then use it as a fixed constant metric tensor throughout {RMHMC} simulation. This eliminates the need for the computationally costly differential geometric Christoffel symbols, which in turn greatly reduces computational effort at a corresponding loss of sampling efficiency. We further reduce the cost of forming the Fisher information matrix by using a low rank approximation via a randomized singular value decomposition technique. This is efficient since a small number of Hessian-vector products are required. The Hessian-vector product in turn requires only two extra {PDE} solves using the adjoint technique. Various numerical results up to 1025 parameters are presented to demonstrate the ability of the {RMHMC} method in exploring the geometric structure of the problem to propose (almost) uncorrelated/independent samples that are far away from each other, and yet the acceptance rate is almost unity. The results also suggest that for the {PDE} models considered the proposed fixed metric {RMHMC} can attain almost as high a quality performance as the original {RMHMC}, i.e. generating (almost) uncorrelated/independent samples, while being two orders of magnitude less computationally expensive.},

	abstract = {Many recent Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) samplers leverage continuous dynamics to define a transition kernel that efficiently explores a target distribution. In tandem, a focus has been on devising scalable variants that subsample the data and use stochastic gradients in place of full-data gradients in the dynamic simulations. However, such stochastic gradient {MCMC} samplers have lagged behind their full-data counterparts in terms of the complexity of dynamics considered since proving convergence in the presence of the stochastic gradient noise is non-trivial. Even with simple dynamics, significant physical intuition is often required to modify the dynamical system to account for the stochastic gradient noise. In this paper, we provide a general recipe for constructing {MCMC} samplers—including stochastic gradient versions—based on continuous Markov processes specified via two matrices. We constructively prove that the framework is complete. That is, any continuous Markov process that provides samples from the target distribution can be written in our framework. We show how previous continuous-dynamic samplers can be trivially "reinvented" in our framework, avoiding the complicated sampler-specific proofs. We likewise use our recipe to straightforwardly propose a new state-adaptive sampler: stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({SGRHMC}). Our experiments on simulated data and a streaming Wikipedia analysis demonstrate that the proposed {SGRHMC} sampler inherits the benefits of Riemann {HMC}, with the scalability of stochastic gradient methods.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous under- standing of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is con- fined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any ex- haustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}) has become routinely used for sampling from posterior distributions. Its extension Riemann manifold {HMC} ({RMHMC}) modifies the proposal kernel through distortion of local distances by a Riemannian metric. The performance depends critically on the choice of metric, with the Fisher information providing the standard choice. In this article, we propose a new class of metrics aimed at improving {HMC}'s performance on multi-modal target distributions. We refer to the proposed approach as geometrically tempered {HMC} ({GTHMC}) due to its connection to other tempering methods. We establish a geometric theory behind {RMHMC} to motivate {GTHMC} and characterize its theoretical properties. Moreover, we develop a novel variable step size integrator for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics to improve on the usual St{\textbackslash}"\{o\}rmer-Verlet integrator which suffers from numerical instability in {GTHMC} settings. We illustrate {GTHMC} through simulations, demonstrating generality and substantial gains over standard {HMC} implementations in terms of effective sample sizes.},

In the former case we find that the conditions for geometric ergodicity are essentially a non-vanishing gradient of the log-density which asymptotically points towards the centre of the space and does not grow faster than linearly. In an idealised scenario in which the integration time is allowed to change in different regions of the space, we show that geometric ergodicity can be recovered for a much broader class of tail behaviours, leading to some guidelines for the choice of this free parameter in practice.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference ({VI}), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. {VI} has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind {VI} is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of {VI} applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in {VI} and highlight important open problems. {VI} is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Using tools from Fredholm integral equation theory, we successfully calculate the second moment of θθ{\textbackslash}theta to obtain a value for the standard deviation of θθ{\textbackslash}theta of nearly 0.5. The “nonsense” correlation, which we call “volatile” correlation, is volatile in the sense that its distribution is heavily dispersed and is frequently large in absolute value. It is induced because each Wiener process is “self-correlated” in time. This is because a Wiener process is an integral of pure noise, and thus its values at different time points are correlated. In addition to providing an explicit formula for the second moment of θθ{\textbackslash}theta, we offer implicit formulas for higher moments of θθ{\textbackslash}theta.},

An asymptotic theory is developed for regressions that relate quite general integrated random processes. This includes the spurious regressions of Granger and Newbold (1974) and the recent cointegrating regressions of Granger and Engle (1985). An asymptotic theory is developed for the regression coefficients and for conventional significance tests. It is shown that the usual t- and F-ratio test statistics do not possess limiting distributions in this context but actually diverge as the sample size T ↑ ∞. The limiting behavior of regression diagnostics such as the Durbin–Watson statistic, the coefficient of determination and the Box–Pierce statistic is also analyzed. The theoretical results that we present explain many of the earlier simulation findings of Granger and Newbold (1974, 1977).},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-{PLUS} and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including {CART}, {MARS}, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

Other major additions deal with new developments concerning the information in equality and simultaneous and shrinkage estimation.

The test statistic is based on a class of estimators of entropy constructed here. The test is shown to be a consistent test of the null hypothesis for all alternatives without a singular continuous part. The power of the test is estimated against several alternatives. It is observed that the test compares favourably with other tests for normality.},

In traditional statistical data analysis, we think of observations of instances of particular phenomena (e.g. instance ↔ human being), these observations being a vector of values we measured on several variables (e.g. blood pressure, weight, height,...). In traditional statistical methodology, we assumed many observations and a few, wellchosen variables. The trend today is towards more observations but even more so, to radically larger numbers of variables – voracious, automatic, systematic collection of hyper-informative detail about each observed instance.

We describe other ways of identifying low-dimensional subspaces of the data space that contain all useful information. The topic of classification is then reviewed along with the problem of identifying, from within a very large set, the variables that help to classify observations. Brief mention is made of the visualization of high-dimensional data and ways to handle computational problems in Bayesian analysis are described.

	abstract = {Scientists and others today often collect samples of curves and other functional observations. This monograph presents many ideas and techniques for such data.  Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modeling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors’ own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields.   This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other recent volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.  Jim Ramsay is Professor of Psychology at {McGill} University and is an international authority on many aspects of multivariate analysis. He was President of the Statistical Society of Canada in 2002-3 and holds the Society’s Gold Medal for his work in functional data analysis.

Nevertheless, the resulting approximations are generally as accurate and in some cases more accurate than approximations based on third-order expansions of the likelihood and requiring the evaluation of third derivatives. The approximate marginal posterior densities behave very much like saddle-point approximations for sampling distributions.

	abstract = {A critical issue for users of Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but to date has yielded relatively little of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most {MCMC} users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of 13 convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all of the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure that they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating {MCMC} sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parametrizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an {MCMC} algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.},

The states are generated efficiently using the Kalman filter. We illustrate our approach by several examples and empirically compare its performance to another Gibbs sampler where the states are generated one at a time.

	abstract = {In a family study of breast cancer, epidemiologists in Southern California increase the power for detecting a gene-environment interaction. In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation.Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces {MCMC} methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of {MCMC} methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying {MCMC} in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing {MCMC}, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains.Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of {MCMC} in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for {MCMC} to be applied to other fields as well.},

The relationship between Markov chains of finite states and matrix theory is also discussed. Chapter 2 discusses the applications of continuous time Markov chains to model queueing systems and discrete time Markov chains for computing. Chapter 3 studies re-manufacturing systems and presents Markovian models for reverse manufacturing applications. In Chapter 4, Hidden Markov models are applied to classify customers. Chapter 5 discusses the Markov decision process for customer lifetime values. Customer Lifetime Values ({CLV}) is an important concept and quantity in marketing management. Chapter 6 covers higher-order Markov chain models. Multivariate Markov models are discussed in Chapter 7. It presents a class of multivariate Markov chain models with a lower order of model parameters. Chapter 8 studies higher-order hidden Markov models. It proposes a class of higher-order hidden Markov models with an efficient algorithm for solving the model parameters.

	abstract = {Monte Carlo statistical methods, particularly those based on Markov chains, are now an essential component of the standard set of techniques used by statisticians. This new edition has been revised towards a coherent and flowing coverage of these simulation techniques, with incorporation of the most recent developments in the field. In particular, the introductory coverage of random variable generation has been totally revised, with many concepts being unified through a fundamental theorem of simulation  There are five completely new chapters that cover Monte Carlo control, reversible jump, slice sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, and perfect sampling. There is a more in-depth coverage of Gibbs sampling, which is now contained in three consecutive chapters. The development of Gibbs sampling starts with slice sampling and its connection with the fundamental theorem of simulation, and builds up to two-stage Gibbs sampling and its theoretical properties. A third chapter covers the multi-stage Gibbs sampler and its variety of applications. Lastly, chapters from the previous edition have been revised towards easier access, with the examples getting more detailed coverage.  This textbook is intended for a second year graduate course, but will also be useful to someone who either wants to apply simulation techniques for the resolution of practical problems or wishes to grasp the fundamental principles behind those methods. The authors do not assume familiarity with Monte Carlo techniques (such as random variable generation), with computer programming, or with any Markov chain theory (the necessary concepts are developed in Chapter 6). A solutions manual, which covers approximately 40\% of the problems, is available for instructors who require the book for a course.  Christian P.

The main result is a weak convergence result as the dimension of a sequence of target densities, n, converges to ∞. When the proposal variance is appropriately scaled according to n, the sequence of stochastic processes formed by the first component of each Markov chain converges to the appropriate limiting Langevin diffusion process. The limiting diffusion approximation admits a straightforward efficiency maximization problem, and the resulting asymptotically optimal policy is related to the asymptotic acceptance rate of proposed moves for the algorithm. The asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 under quite general conditions. The main result is proved in the case where the target density has a symmetric product form. Extensions of the result are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) method, as a computer-intensive statistical tool, has enjoyed an enormous upsurge in interest over the last few years. This paper provides a simple, comprehensive and tutorial review of some of the most common areas of research in this field. We begin by discussing how {MCMC} algorithms can be constructed from standard building-blocks to produce Markov chains with the desired stationary distribution. We also motivate and discuss more complex ideas that have been proposed in the literature, such as continuous time and dimension jumping methods. We discuss some implementational issues associated with {MCMC} methods. We take a look at the arguments for and against multiple replications, consider how long chains should be run for and how to determine suitable starting points. We also take a look at graphical models and how graphical approaches can be used to simplify {MCMC} implementation. Finally, we present a couple of examples, which we use as case-studies to highlight some of the points made earlier in the text. In particular, we use a simple changepoint model to illustrate how to tackle a typical Bayesian modelling problem via the {MCMC} method, before using mixture model problems to provide illustrations of good sampler output and of the implementation of a reversible jump {MCMC} algorithm.},

	abstract = {I present a new Markov chain sampling method appropriate for distributions with isolated modes. Like the recently developed method of ‘simulated tempering’, the ‘tempered transition’ method uses a series of distributions that interpolate between the distribution of interest and a distribution for which sampling is easier. The new method has the advantage that it does not require approximate values for the normalizing constants of these distributions, which are needed for simulated tempering, and can be tedious to estimate. Simulated tempering performs a random walk along the series of distributions used. In contrast, the tempered transitions of the new method move systematically from the desired distribution, to the easily-sampled distribution, and back to the desired distribution. This systematic movement avoids the inefficiency of a random walk, an advantage that is unfortunately cancelled by an increase in the number of interpolating distributions required. Because of this, the sampling efficiency of the tempered transition method in simple problems is similar to that of simulated tempering. On more complex distributions, however, simulated tempering and tempered transitions may perform differently. Which is better depends on the ways in which the interpolating distributions are ‘deceptive’.},

	abstract = {Background
Parameter estimation for differential equation models of intracellular processes is a highly relevant bu challenging task. The available experimental data do not usually contain enough information to identify all parameters uniquely, resulting in ill-posed estimation problems with often highly correlated parameters. Sampling-based Bayesian statistical approaches are appropriate for tackling this problem. The samples are typically generated via Markov chain Monte Carlo, however such methods are computationally expensive and their convergence may be slow, especially if there are strong correlations between parameters. Monte Carlo methods based on Euclidean or Riemannian Hamiltonian dynamics have been shown to outperform other samplers by making proposal moves that take the local sensitivities of the system’s states into account and accepting these moves with high probability. However, the high computational cost involved with calculating the Hamiltonian trajectories prevents their widespread use for all but the smallest differential equation models. The further development of efficient sampling algorithms is therefore an important step towards improving the statistical analysis of predictive models of intracellular processes.

Results
We show how state of the art Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods may be significantly improved for steady state dynamical models. We present a novel approach for efficiently calculating the required geometric quantities by tracking steady states across the Hamiltonian trajectories using a Newton-Raphson method and employing local sensitivity information. Using our approach, we compare both Euclidean and Riemannian versions of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on three models for intracellular processes with real data and demonstrate at least an order of magnitude improvement in the effective sampling speed. We further demonstrate the wider applicability of our approach to other gradient based {MCMC} methods, such as those based on Langevin diffusions.

Conclusion
Our approach is strictly benefitial in all test cases. The Matlab sources implementing our {MCMC} methodology is available from https://github.com/a-kramer/ode\_rmhmc.

	abstract = {The name of Bernard Riemann is well known to mathematicians and physicists around the world. College students encounter the Riemann integral early in their studies. Real and complex function theories are founded on Riemann’s work. Einstein’s theory of gravitation would be unthinkable without Riemannian geometry. In number theory, Riemann’s famous conjecture stands as one of the classic challenges to the best mathematical minds and continues to stimulate deep mathematical research. The name is indelibly stamped on the literature of mathematics and physics. This book, originally written in German and presented here in an English-language translation, examines Riemann’s scientific work from a single unifying perspective. Laugwitz describes Riemann’s development of a conceptual approach to mathematics at a time when conventional algorithmic thinking dictated that formulas and figures, rigid constructs, and transformations of terms were the only legitimate means of studying mathematical objects. David Hilbert gave prominence to the Riemannian principle of utilizing thought, not calculation, to achieve proofs. Hermann Weyl interpreted the Riemann principle — for mathematics and physics alike — to be a matter of "understanding the world through its behavior in the infinitely small." This remarkable work, rich in insight and scholarship, is addressed to mathematicians, physicists, and philosophers interested in mathematics. It seeks to draw those readers closer to the underlying ideas of Riemann’s work and to the development of them in their historical context. This illuminating English-language version of the original German edition will be an important contribution to the literature of the history of mathematics. "There is excellent referencing throughout... Quotes are given almost always both in English and in the original German. Many readers will feel the original German brings them a bit closer to Riemann and his contemporaries... Laugwitz’s expertise on historical matters is most impressive... Thanks are due to both author and translator for making it much easier to enter into the literature on Riemann." —{MAA} Online "...the author has succeeded admirably...stating the technical details clearly and correctly while writing an engaging and readable account of Riemann’s life and work... Any reader of this book with even a passing interest in the history or philosophy of mathematics is certain to become engaged in a mental conversation with the author... The format of the book is excellent, especially the plentiful supply of photographs of people and places... The book will serve as an interesting read and also a useful reference... It is highly recommended." —Bulletin of the {AMS}},

The methods developed provide generalisations of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian statistical inference, and resolve many shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlation structure.  The performance of these Riemannian manifold Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is rigorously assessed by performing Bayesian inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point process models, stochastic volatility models, and both parameter and model level inference of dynamical systems described by nonlinear differential equations.},

In this book the authors outline the principles of geometric integration and demonstrate how they can be applied to provide efficient numerical methods for simulating conservative models. Beginning from basic principles and continuing with discussions regarding the advantageous properties of such schemes, the book introduces methods for the N-body problem, systems with holonomic constraints, and rigid bodies. More advanced topics treated include high-order and variable stepsize methods, schemes for treating problems involving multiple time-scales, and applications to molecular dynamics and partial differential equations. The emphasis is on providing a unified theoretical framework as well as a practical guide for users. The inclusion of examples, background material and exercises enhance the usefulness of the book for self-instruction or as a text for a graduate course on the subject.},

This article illustrates concepts and results of geometric numerical integration on the important example of the Störmer–Verlet method. It thus presents a cross-section of the recent monograph by the authors, enriched by some additional material.After an introduction to the Newton–Störmer–Verlet–leapfrog method and its various interpretations, there follows a discussion of geometric properties: reversibility, symplecticity, volume preservation, and conservation of first integrals. The extension to Hamiltonian systems on manifolds is also described. The theoretical foundation relies on a backward error analysis, which translates the geometric properties of the method into the structure of a modified differential equation, whose flow is nearly identical to the numerical method. Combined with results from perturbation theory, this explains the excellent long-time behaviour of the method: long-time energy conservation, linear error growth and preservation of invariant tori in near-integrable systems, a discrete virial theorem, and preservation of adiabatic invariants.},

The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view.Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

However, for many models in psychology, Bayesian estimation of model parameters can be difficult. One reason for this difficulty is that conventional sampling algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}), can be inefficient and impractical when little is known about the target distribution—particularly the target distribution’s covariance structure. In this article, we highlight some reasons for this inefficiency and advocate the use of a population {MCMC} algorithm, called differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo ({DE}-{MCMC}), as a means of efficient proposal generation. We demonstrate in a simulation study that the performance of the {DE}-{MCMC} algorithm is unaffected by the correlation of the target distribution, whereas conventional {MCMC} performs substantially worse as the correlation increases. We then show that the {DE}-{MCMC} algorithm can be used to efficiently fit a hierarchical version of the linear ballistic accumulator model to response time data, which has proven to be a difficult task when conventional {MCMC} is used.},

To avoid this possibility, we recommend choosing the number of burn-in iterations r by applying convergence diagnostics to one or more pilot chains, and then basing estimation and inference on a separate long chain from which the first r iterations have been discarded.},

However, the explicit use of quality assessments of the {MCMC} simulations—convergence diagnostics—in phylogenetics is still uncommon. Here, we present a simple tool that uses the output from {MCMC} simulations and visualizes a number of properties of primary interest in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, such as convergence rates of posterior split probabilities and branch lengths. Graphical exploration of the output from phylogenetic {MCMC} simulations gives intuitive and often crucial information on the success and reliability of the analysis. The tool presented here complements convergence diagnostics already available in other software packages primarily designed for other applications of {MCMC}. Importantly, the common practice of using trace-plots of a single parameter or summary statistic, such as the likelihood score of sampled trees, can be misleading for assessing the success of a phylogenetic {MCMC} simulation.Availability: The program is available as source under the {GNU} General Public License and as a web application at http://ceb.scs.fsu.edu/{awtyContact}:jwilgenb@scs.fsu.edu},

	shorttitle = {{CODA}},
	abstract = {[1st paragraph] At first sight, Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) appears to be straightforward. The user defines a full probability model, perhaps using one of the programs discussed in this issue; an underlying sampling engine takes the model definition and returns a sequence of dependent samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the supplied data. The user can derive any summary of the posterior distribution from this sample. For example, to calculate a 95\% credible interval for a parameter α, it suffices to take 1000 {MCMC} iterations of α and sort them so that α$_{\textrm{1}}${\textless}α$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}...{\textless}α$_{\textrm{1000}}$. The credible interval estimate is then (α$_{\textrm{25}}$, α$_{\textrm{975}}$). However, there is a price to be paid for this simplicity. Unlike most numerical methods used in statistical inference, {MCMC} does not give a clear indication of whether it has converged. The underlying Markov chain theory only guarantees that the distribution of the output will converge to the posterior in the limit as the number of iterations increases to infinity. The user is generally ignorant about how quickly convergence occurs, and therefore has to fall back on post hoc testing of the sampled output. By convention, the sample is divided into two parts: a “burn in” period during which all samples are discarded, and the remainder of the run in which the chain is considered to have converged sufficiently close to the limiting distribution to be used. Two questions then arise: 1. How long should the burn in period be? 2. How many samples are required to accurately estimate posterior quantities of interest? The \textbf{coda} package for R contains a set of functions designed to help the user answer these questions. Some of these convergence diagnostics are simple graphical ways of summarizing the data. Others are formal statistical tests.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic inference is an attractive approach to uncertain reasoning and empirical learning in artificial intelligence. Computational difficulties arise, however, because probabilistic models with the necessary realism and flexibility lead to complex distributions over high-dimensional spaces. Related problems in other fields have been tackled using Monte Carlo methods based on sampling using Markov chains, providing a rich array of techniques that can be applied to problems in artificial intelligence. The "Metropolis algorithm" has been used to solve difficult problems in statistical physics for over forty years, and, in the last few years, the related method of "Gibbs sampling" has been applied to problems of statistical inference. Concurrently, an alternative method for solving problems in statistical physics by means of dynamical simulation has been developed as well, and has recently been unified with the Metropolis algorithm to produce the "hybrid Monte Carlo" method. In computer science, Markov chain sampling is the basis of the heuristic optimization technique of "simulated annealing", and has recently been used in randomized algorithms for approximate counting of large sets. In this review, I outline the role of probabilistic inference in artificial intelligence, and present the theory of Markov chains, and describe various Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, along with a number of supporting techniques. I try to present a comprehensive picture of the range of methods that have been developed, including techniques from the varied literature that have not yet seen wide application in artificial intelligence, but which appear relevant. As illustrative examples, I use the problems of probabilistic inference in expert systems, discovery of latent classes from data, and Bayesian learning for neural networks.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

The text presents complete coverage of all the functionalities of {BUGS}, including prediction, missing data, model criticism, and prior sensitivity.

It deals with essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative priors, and thoughtful choice of prior distributions—all those aspects of the "art" of modelling that are easily overlooked in more theoretical expositions.   More pragmatic than ideological, the authors systematically work through the large range of "tricks" that reveal the real power of the {BUGS} software, for example, dealing with missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction, ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the examples are biostatistical, but they do not require domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range of other application areas.

	isbn = {978-1-4786-1005-2},
	abstract = {All macroscopic systems consist ultimately of atoms obeying the laws of quantum mechanics. That premise forms the basis for this comprehensive text, intended for a first upper-level course in statistical and thermal physics. Reif emphasizes that the combination of microscopic concepts with some statistical postulates leads readily to conclusions on a purely macroscopic level. The authors writing style and penchant for description energize interest in condensed matter physics as well as provide a conceptual grounding with information that is crystal clear and memorable.Reif first introduces basic probability concepts and statistical methods used throughout all of physics. Statistical ideas are then applied to systems of particles in equilibrium to enhance an understanding of the basic notions of statistical mechanics, from which derive the purely macroscopic general statements of thermodynamics. Next, he turns to the more complicated equilibrium situations, such as phase transformations and quantum gases, before discussing nonequilibrium situations in which he treats transport theory and dilute gases at varying levels of sophistication. In the last chapter, he addresses some general questions involving irreversible processes and fluctuations.A large amount of material is presented to facilitate students later access to more advanced works, to allow those with higher levels of curiosity to read beyond the minimum given on a topic, and to enhance understanding by presenting several ways of looking at a particular question. Formatting within the text either signals material that instructors can assign at their own discretion or highlights important results for easy reference to them. Additionally, by solving many of the 230 problems contained in the text, students activate and embed their knowledge of the subject matter.},

In the last five years, {MCMC} has been introduced into significance testing, general Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood estimation. This paper presents basic methodology of {MCMC}, emphasizing the Bayesian paradigm, conditional probability and the intimate relationship with Markov random fields in spatial statistics. Hastings algorithms are discussed, including Gibbs, Metropolis and some other variations. Pairwise difference priors are described and are used subsequently in three Bayesian applications, in each of which there is a pronounced spatial or temporal aspect to the modeling. The examples involve logistic regression in the presence of unobserved covariates and ordinal factors; the analysis of agricultural field experiments, with adjustment for fertility gradients; and processing of low-resolution medical images obtained by a gamma camera. Additional methodological issues arise in each of these applications and in the Appendices. The paper lays particular emphasis on the calculation of posterior probabilities and concurs with others in its view that {MCMC} facilitates a fundamental breakthrough in applied Bayesian modeling.},

	abstract = {Gibbs sampling is a powerful technique for statistical inference. It involves little more than sampling from full conditional distributions, which can be both complex and computationally expensive to evaluate. Gilks and Wild have shown that in practice full conditionals are often log-concave, and they proposed a method of adaptive rejection sampling for efficiently sampling from univariate log-concave distributions. In this paper, to deal with non-log-concave full conditional distributions, we generalize adaptive rejection sampling to include a Hastings-Metropolis algorithm step. One important field of application in which statistical models may lead to non-log-concave full conditionals is population pharmacokinetics. Here, the relationship between drug dose and blood or plasma concentration in a group of patients typically is modelled by using non-linear mixed effects models. Often, the data used for analysis are routinely collected hospital measurements, which tend to be noisy and irregular. Consequently, a robust (t-distributed) error structure is appropriate to account for outlying observations and/or patients. We propose a robust non-linear full probability model for population pharmacokinetic data. We demonstrate that our method enables Bayesian inference for this model, through an analysis of antibiotic administration in new-born babies.},

It covers a broad range of numerical and analytical methods that are essential for the correct analysis of scientific data, including probability theory, distribution functions of statistics, fits to two-dimensional data and parameter estimation, Monte Carlo methods and Markov chains.  Features new to this edition include:  • a discussion of statistical techniques employed in business science, such as multiple regression analysis of multivariate datasets.• a new chapter on the various measures of the mean including logarithmic averages.• new chapters on systematic errors and intrinsic scatter, and on the fitting of data with bivariate errors.• a new case study and additional worked examples.• mathematical derivations and theoretical background material have been appropriately marked, to improve the readability of the text.• end-of-chapter summary boxes, for easy reference. As in the first edition, the main pedagogical method is a theory-then-application approach, where emphasis is placed first on a sound understanding of the underlying theory of a topic, which becomes the basis for an efficient and practical application of the material. The level is appropriate for undergraduates and beginning graduate students, and as a reference for the experienced researcher. Basic calculus is used in some of the derivations, and no previous background in probability and statistics is required.

When applied to a Bayesian missing data problem, the Gibbs sampler produces two natural approximations for the posterior distribution of the parameter vector: the empirical distribution based on the sampled values of the parameter vector, and a mixture of complete data posteriors. We prove that Rao-Blackwellization causes a one-lag delay for the autocovariances among dependent samples obtained from data augmentation, and consequently, the mixture approximation produces estimates with smaller variances than the empirical approximation. The covariance structure results are used to compare different augmentation schemes. It is shown that collapsing and grouping random components in a Gibbs sampler with two or three components usually result in more efficient sampling schemes.},
