\title{Calculates Potential Scale Reduction Factor (psrf), also called the Rhat statistic,
from models fit via \code{mh} or \code{hmc}}
\usage{
psrf(object, burnin, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{hmclearn}, usually a result of a call to \code{mh} or \code{hmc}}

\item{burnin}{optional numeric parameter for the number of initial MCMC samples to omit from the summary}

\item{...}{currently unused}
}
\description{
Gelman and Rubin's diagnostic assesses the mix of multiple MCMC chain with different initial parameter values
Values close to 1 indicate that the posterior simulation has sufficiently converged, while
values above 1 indicate that additional samples may be necessary to ensure convergence.  A general
guideline suggests that values less than 1.05 are good, between 1.05 and 1.10 are ok, and above 1.10
have not converged well.
