\description{
Gelman and Rubin's diagnostic assesses the mix of multiple MCMC chain with different initial parameter values
Values close to 1 indicate that the posterior simulation has sufficiently converged, while
values above 1 indicate that additional samples may be necessary to ensure convergence.  A general
guideline suggests that values less than 1.05 are good, between 1.05 and 1.10 are ok, and above 1.10
have not converged well.
